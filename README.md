# Password-Generator
In this project, i have built a password generator, something that's going to generate strong passwords with letters and symbols and numbers. 
First, it will ask how many letters would you like in your password? 
Then it will ask How many symbols followed by numbers would you like? 
Hence it gives me the password that it has generated with given numbers, symbols and letters.

I have used python loops to generate password.
